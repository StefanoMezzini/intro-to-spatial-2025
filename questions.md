obtaining data in different time periods (eg different months) and combine to have yearly data. 
Using R to extract data from a map that is only partially covered by features, eg distance from the edge of a feature's perimeter
I would be most interested in spatial clustering methods
Tips on efficient data/code management would also be nice to include in this workshop. Thanks!
Lecture slides and materials needed for the workshop and used during the workshop to be provided prior to the workshop to be prepared for the workshop please.
